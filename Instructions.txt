Instructions on how the project is organized and works

1. First the file "logProject.sh" takes the content from syslog and basically put it into the mysql table

2. Then the "mainForm.php" connects to a database where the table is holding the content and then display it on a webpage (screenshot of the webpage incuded)

Files included:
	
	1. "saveLog.txt" where the original content of syslog is created by the first grep 		   command in "logProject.sh"
	2. "severity.txt", "tag.txt", "time.txt", "description.txt" are seperate files for each 	   labeled content.
	3. "temptale.csv" is created from the content of above files to easily extract data to a 	    mysql table
	4. "logProject.sh", "mainForm.php" main code files
	5. Screenshot of the output of webpage.
	6. "account.php" is a template needs to be filled in with information about you mysql 		   database
